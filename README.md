# oslab-assignments
This repo contains solutions for assignments of the _Opearating Systems Laboratory_ course at National Technical University of Athens.

## Exercise 1
This exercise contained a number of system challenges that we had to solve using different operating system concepts. Concepts utilize to "solve" the challenges include:
* signals
* linking
* I/O streams
* user permissions
* enviroment variables
* pipes
* sparse files
* processes
* memory mapping (mmap)
* dynamic libraries

## Exercise 2
This exercise involved developing a character device driver. Parts of the driver code (TTY layer) were given to us and we had to develop the rest of the driver.

## Exercise 3
This exercise required us to implement an encrypred chat between a QEMU virtual machine and its respective host machine. For the guest-host communication, VirtIO was used. For the message exchange we made use of sockets.
